List of considerations concerning foreground moments project -- Ongoing.

----- w3j -----
 - possible the high ell w3j coefficients are not correct due to code inaccuracies
        - could try a different package for w3j calculation and compare

 - the truncation effect of the w3j sum in the 1x1 term
        - this does not appear to have a large effect empirically

 - consistency tests should continue to be done on the w3j function after the stages of optimisation


---- realisation -----
 - the data fluctuate due to cosmic variance in each realisation, quantifying this effect is important

 - the model (the 1x1 and 0x2) fluctuate with realisation due to the beta map standardisation of sigma
        - can partially negate this by calculating the 1x1 and 0x2 in the same function, so from the same bcls each time
        - try to find a functional form relating the needed amplitude of the beta map to the gamma exponent, so we can
          make it independent of realisation

 - chi2 values of a fit vary within an order of magnitude due to realisation
        - was previously much worse (up to 5-6 orders) but those were due to mono/dipole effects
        - this is probably fine and within cosmic variance, error plots with cosmic variance should be made though

---- convergence ----
 - we currently have the maps set up so the std of the beta map is 1/3 the critical value for convergence. How close can we get
   before this totally breaks?

 - divergence at gamma = -2, does this correspond to anything physical? This is a statement of validity of moment expansion.

 - Condition for gamma < -2, excludes possibility of white noise. This is possibly related to validity of expansion.
