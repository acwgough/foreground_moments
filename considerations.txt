List of considerations concerning foreground moments project -- Ongoing.

----- w3j -----
 - the truncation effect of the w3j sum in the 1x1 term
        - this does not appear to have a large effect empirically


---- realisation -----
 - the data fluctuate due to cosmic variance in each realisation, quantifying this effect is important


---- convergence ----
 - we currently have the maps set up so the std of the beta map is 1/3 the critical value for convergence. How close can we get
   before this totally breaks?

 - divergence at gamma = -2, does this correspond to anything physical? This is a statement of validity of moment expansion.

 - Condition for gamma < -2, excludes possibility of white noise. This is possibly related to validity of expansion.

---- fitting ----
 - creating the data at higher nside and cutting off avoids the over shooting in the model due to finite nside. Should probably modify the objective
   function eventually to quantify this effect.

---- mcmc ----
 - need to do tests for convergence and consistency with the mcmcs.

 - investigate the effect of priors, even nonphysical ones (e.g. r<0).
 - investigate the effect of different starting positions and positions of walkers relative to that starting position.

 - add in the moment terms for the mcmc.


---- going forward ----
 - adding cross spectra
