    "Note, before you can run anything involving the 1x1 moment you'll need to run the script `w3j.py`. This will generate a numpy file that stores the w3j coefficients and is loaded in to the 1x1 moment to speed up calculation. The `w3j.npy` file is too large to push to GitHib so you'll have to build it locally. Make sure that the max $\\ell$ used to build the w3j numpy file matches the max $\\ell$ being used elsewhere in your calculations, otherwise you run into problems (currently everything is setup to a default of $\\ell_{\\rm max}=384$ corresponding to nside=128.\n",
